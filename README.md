# Hello!

This project is a personal website built with Next.js.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

- `pages/`: This directory contains all the pages for the website. Each file in this directory represents a different page on the website. Pages are automatically routed based on their file names.

- `components/`: This directory contains all the reusable components used across the website. Each component is typically a self-contained unit with its own styles and functionality.

- `public/`: This directory contains all the static assets used on the website such as images, fonts, and other files. Any file placed in this directory can be referenced using the `/public` URL path.

- `styles/`: This directory contains all the styles for the website. 

- `api/`: This directory can be used to create server-side API routes.

## TypeScript
This project is built using TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that helps catch errors and provides better code completion and documentation. However, regular JavaScript can also be used in a Next.js project if preferred.

## Tools Used
During the development of this project, I utilized ChatGPT and GitHub Copilot to accelerate my learning and development process. ChatGPT is a large language model trained by OpenAI that can answer natural language questions and provide explanations on a variety of topics. GitHub Copilot is an AI-powered code completion tool that provides suggestions for code snippets based on the context of your code.

Using ChatGPT, I was able to quickly learn about the concepts and best practices of Next.js and TypeScript, and get answers to any questions I had along the way. ChatGPT provided detailed explanations and examples that helped me gain a deeper understanding of these technologies.

In fact, this entire README (except for lines 1 and 27) was written by ChatGPT.
